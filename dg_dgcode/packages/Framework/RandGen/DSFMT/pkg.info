SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister (SFMT) from
http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/SFMT/

Primary author: thomas.kittelmann@ess.eu

Detailed information:

Current version dumped here is version 2.2 (downloaded Dec 7 2012), and a line
in the header file dSFMT has been edited to ensure that DSFMT_MEXP=19937 will be
picked without warnings or need for compilation flags (look for the line with
"TK - commented"). The compilation flags applied in non-DEBUG mode were those
recommended in the documentation.
